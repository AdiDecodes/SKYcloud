            Your privacy is important to us. We respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you

            Asking for information
        </h3>
        <div class="my-3">
            We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by
            fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we're collecting it and how
            it will be used.

        <h3>
            Information retention
        </h3>

        <div class="my-3">
            We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service.
            What data we store, we'll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well
            as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

        <h3>Sharing information
        </h3>

        <div class="my-3">
            We don't share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required
            to by law. Our apps may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no
            control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for
            their respective privacy policies.

            We use a third party service to provide the weather information in our Weather app
            <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/api/weather">https://api-ninjas.com/api/weather</a>. If you choose to share
            your location with us when
            using our apps, we send that location to our third party weather service provider to request local weather
            information. We do not share or sell this location information with other third parties.

            Your continued use of our apps will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal
            information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to
            contact us.
            <br><br>
            This policy is effective as of 8 December 2022.
