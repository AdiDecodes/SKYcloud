## FAQ

#### Do I need to provide some credentials to use?

Absolutely No! No credentials are required to use, just put the Cityname & you're good to go.

#### I've noticed that some data is inaccurate?

SKYCLOUD works with the help of third party API (pc - server - data). The data we get is almost accurate and can be determined in a correct way. Although, It is not possible to give exact data.

#### How it fetches my region's weather?

SKYCLOUD uses geolocation to get the current location & City name. It is not used in any other form. For more details, Visit [Privacy Policy](link)
